<a href="https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/principles/" target="_blank">Google Tech Dev Guide</a><br />
<b>Topic: </b>Software Engineeering Principles<br />
<b>Summary of resource: </b>A Google's platform to practice important skills that I'll need to be a successful software developer â€” testing, debugging, design, documentation, and open source..<br />
<b>My Review: </b>In the tech world, especially for jobs in engineering, it's really important to know how to test, fix bugs, design, and write documentation. Google teaches these important skills because they're key to working on new and exciting projects. Google's entire Tech Dev Guide (not only the Software Engineering Principles course) is a great place for Software Developers. It covers basic computer science, how to structure data, different programming languages, and lots more. It's super helpful whether you're getting ready for a job interview in tech or just want to get better at making your own projects.<br />

<b>Topic: </b>Web development<br />
<b>Summary of resource: </b>The world's largest web developer site, providing a full range of technologies covering web, mobile, front-end, and back-end development<br />
<b>My Review: </b>W3Schools is essentially source #1 when you need immediate help while writing code. It provides everything necessary for app development. All materials are structured in an easy-to-navigate and searchable manner. Whether I need information about an HTML tag, a brief introduction to a new concept, or to practice coding skills, this resource is always a great assistant.<br />

<a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank">Leetcode</a><br />
<b>Topic: </b>Algorithms and Data Structures<br />
<b>Summary of resource: </b>LeetCode is a platform for enhancing coding and problem solving skills, expanding knowledge, and preparing for technical interviews.<br />
<b>My Review: </b>While it's not teaching how to create web projects, it's teaching critical skills like data structures, algorithms, problem-solving, and critical thinking. These skills are required for preparing for and passing technical interviews, especially in large companies. FAANG companies ask to resolve similar challenges in technical interviews. So, it is critical to practice-practice-practice such skills. Mastering such skills will help to become a better software engineer, and expand thinking horizons in creating apps.<br />

  <b>Topic: </b>Full-Stack Engineer Career Path<br />
  <b>Summary of resource: </b>Learning materials for the career path of the Full-Stack Engineer. It teaches how to create projects from start to finish, covering both front-end and back-end development.<br />
  <b>My Review: </b>The syllabus of this course includes everything needed to become a full-stack developer. With such comprehensive knowledge, I will be able to implement my own project, work on enterprise projects, or join a startup and build applications from scratch. The platform provides a theoretical part, as well as quizzes to assess theory understanding and hands-on projects to consolidate practical skills. I am going to register for this course to gain this knowledge and start my own project.<br />

    <b>Topic: </b>Git<br />
    <b>Summary of resource: </b>Practical. in-depth, visual guide to Git<br />
    <b>My Review: </b>Despite the abundance of video resources on working with Git, this project caught my attention because it is in text format and is written not in a dry, bookish interpretation, but in the lively text of a Git professional. It also provides plenty of illustrations to facilitate the understanding of information. I will refer to this resource when I need to know how to properly write a certain Git command, and when I need to find out what other possibilities Git offers in project development that I am not yet aware of.<br />
